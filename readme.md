# seahorse
**seahorse** is 369 or so males pumping out 2000 or so young per batch and a teaching project for new validators. 

We don't have a cla or anything.  BE NICE to each other.  Understand that this is a place where genderbendy jokes and god knows what else is okay.  But not mean ones.  No obligation to make sense.  No pre-sale.  369 validators with equal stake and all of that safely vaested/



# Goals
* Train new validators in cosmos
* Train new relayers in cosmos
* research overlay networks
* research launches that cost tiny amounts of money
* have a validator web ui so that validation is:
  * connect power
  * boot
  * dhcp (wired only)
  * state sync
  * web ui with node info
* Train new cosmos validators and request their feedback on their learning experience to figure out how to create other "learn by doing" blockchains
* Drain all liquidity away from lum as punishment for denying their market manipulation and thinking that the past connects to the present.  Maybe we can find them a shrink but they're confused.  For now tho.
  * We will incentivize the movement of liquidity lum->sea
* ibc in and out of as many chains as can be
*
