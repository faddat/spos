# Seahorse

Seahorse is the distillation of Notional's knowledge about validation, relaying, networking, and systems into a linux distro that includes a blockchain.

Arch-based Linux OS for P2P apps. 

Peer to peer applications tend to involve a complex stack and are therefore difficult to begin developing. SOS provides you with a complete development environment, As well as patterns and ideas to follow.

This image represents an opinionated approach to the construction of distributed and p2p applications.

### Variants

* Full
  * The full image is a development environment with P2P development tooling ready to go:
    * Starport
    * HNS or HNSD
    * IPFS
    * Gox
    * Docker
    * Go
    * Node.js
    * Zerotier
* Lite
  * Docker
  * Docker-compose

### Supported Devices & Platforms
SOS targets ARM64 and AMD64 processors. 

* Raspberry Pi 3
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Odroid C2
* Minimus

[Arch Linux](archlinux.org) was a very deliberate choice: In contrast to other distributions, arch packages are always up-to-date. Additionally, the arch user repository offers a wide variety of easy to install packages contributed by the community.


### Vital Information:

- designed to be consumed by your favorite CI system and used in the production of ready made system images.

  - defaults to GitHub Actions

- No binaries are used in the build process. All source code is copied to /spos so that users can easily rebuild the operating system. The Raspberry Pi 4 64 bit kernel is currently built elsewhere to save time, but we use a fully-open implementation. If you have spare time, you can build it from [source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-raspberrypi4-aarch64/). It is blob-free.

- FAST
  - Full builds take ~30 minutes.
  - SPOS can produce a fully-cached image on a hetzner A61x in about 2 minutes.
  - Docker pull cann be used to load spos into your docker cache.

- one OS for every platform:
  - Cloud
    - AMI (AMD64 & ARM64)
  - Mobile (PinePhone, PineTab)
  - Router
    - Dawn
  - Laptop
    - Samsung
